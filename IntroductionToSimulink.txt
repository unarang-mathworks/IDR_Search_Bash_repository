Simulink 
To transform development of complex systems, market-leading companies adopt Model-Based Design by systematically using models throughout the entire process.

Use a virtual model to simulate and test your system early and often
Validate your design with physical models, Hardware-in-the-Loop testing, and rapid prototyping
Generate production-quality C, C++, CUDA, PLC, Verilog, and VHDL code and deploy directly to your embedded system
Maintain a digital thread with traceability through requirements, system architecture, component design, code and tests
Extend models to systems in operation to perform predictive maintenance and fault analysis sachink
